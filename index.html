<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages. Internet backbone refers to the main system of high speed data connections that form the core infrastructure of the internet. It has large fast networks that carry the bulk of data between various regions and networks, to ensure smooth communication and data transfers across the globe.
Servers deliver the data, Clients ask for data.
Servers are for powerful computers that store and manage data like files, websites or apps. When asked for information, the server provides it.                                                                                     Routers are devices that direct data between networks. They help data find it’s fastest path from one location to another.                                                                                                               Switches are devices that connect within a local network, like offices or home, and help route the data between them.                                                                                                         And workstations are for the individual computers, or devices, used by people who interact with the internet. 
The TCP/IP model is a set of rules that helps devices communicate over the internet. It has four layers: the Application layer, where software like web browsers work; the Transport layer, which ensures reliable data transfer using protocols like TCP; the Internet layer , which handles addressing and routing using IP; and the Link layer, which deals with physical connections like cables or Wi-Fi. This model breaks down data into small packets, addresses them correctly, and ensures they travel across networks from client devices to servers, allowing for smooth communication in client/server relationships.
Email, File sharing, Web browsing.
Hypertext is text that holds links to other text, web pages, and images.
The Web is a service that runs on the internet. The internet is the global network of computers and servers that connect everything together, while the web is a system of websites and webpages that you can access through browsers. In short, the web uses the internet’s infrastructure to deliver information, like text, images, and videos, to your device. So, the internet is the "network" and the web is one of the main ways we use it.
HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP. HTTP is a protocol that is used to transfer data between your browser and a website.
Web 1.0 (The Static web): This is the early version of the web, where websites were mostly static pages that only displayed information. There was little user interaction, and you could only read content, like on a digital brochure.
Web 2.0 (The Social Web): This is the more dynamic version of the web, where users could actively interact with websites. Social media, blogs, and user-generated content became popular. Websites like Facebook, YouTube, and Wikipedia allowed people to not only consume content but also create and share it.
Web 3.0 (The Decentralized Web): The current stage in development, where the web is becoming smarter and more personalized. It focuses on using technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain to give users more control, enhance privacy, and allow decentralized applications. It aims to be more connected and intelligent, providing better and more customized user experiences.
The development of our web has evolved through 3 important stages including. Web 1.0, web 2.0, and web 3.0. Web 1.0, developed in the 2000s, was static and full of information, where many users could only be able to view content without interactions. Web 2.0 introduced us to interactivity, allowing individuals to engage, create, and share content through blogs, social media, and various other online platforms. And today's web 3.0. Where we focus on smarter tech, improved privacy, decentralization, and more personalized interactions using technologies like AI, virtual reality, and blockchain. Helping give our users more control over their digital and data environments. 
Starting with web 1.0, it was static and one way, not giving users much accessibility through personal experience. Web 2.0 has introduced us to interactive features, dynamic, allowing individuals to share, create, and  have more hands-on experience with social media. And Web 3.0. Web 3.0 focuses more on security, personalization, and decentralization. Exploiting technologies like Ai, blockchain, and virtual reality to give us users more control with our data and create smarter, more captivating online involvement. 
Markup languages including XML, HTML, and markdown, work as the foundation for presenting and structuring content on the web. They show how images, text, links, and other elements are displayed in the browser. Markup languages allow content to be organized, linked, and styled, completing an ongoing functional user experience across various devices and platforms.
Markup and scripting languages serve different jobs in web development. Markup languages are used to structure and organize users' content, focusing on explaining elements and their relationships without behaviour or logic. They tell the browser how to show its content. While markup languages describe the content structure, scripting languages complete actions like manipulating the page in real time or responding to user inputs. 
SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) is the parent standard from which XML and HTML derive. XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a flexible, stricter version of SGML designed for data storage and transfer, allowing users to define custom tags. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a subset of SGML tailored for creating and displaying web content, while XHTML (Extensible HTML) is a reformulation of HTML with stricter XML rules, improving its consistency across browsers. DHTML (Dynamic HTML) refers to a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that enables dynamic, interactive web pages. Markdown (MD) is a lightweight, human-readable markup language used for formatting text, commonly used in documentation and content management systems. In summary, SGML serves as the foundation for XML and HTML, while XML and XHTML refine HTML’s structure, and DHTML adds dynamic features. Markdown simplifies content formatting for ease of use.
One of my main interests is being a therapist. I am personally very invested in helping individuals get the help they need, to lead to a better healthier life. To get to that stage of my life, being a therapist, i will need master of science along with master of arts.
CSE1210 can be important in many of our future careers. It contributes to developing problem solving skills, an understanding of technology, and programing knowledge that can be applied across various industries.
